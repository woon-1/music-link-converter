# Migration Notes: Web ‚Üí React Native iOS App

## Summary

Successfully converted the music link converter from a web application to a React Native iOS mobile app using Expo.

## What Changed

### New Files Created

1. **App.js** - Main React Native component
   - Converted from vanilla JavaScript + HTML to React Native components
   - Uses React hooks (useState, useRef)
   - Mobile-optimized UI with TouchableOpacity, SafeAreaView, Modal
   - Platform-specific styling using StyleSheet

2. **services/** directory (new location)
   - Copied from `src/services/`
   - Updated all service files to use `CONFIG` instead of `process.env`
   - Added `config.js` for API keys configuration

3. **Configuration Files**
   - `app.json` - Expo app configuration
   - `babel.config.js` - Babel configuration for Expo
   - `.env.example` - Template for API keys
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude Expo/React Native specific files

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated `README.md` for mobile app
   - Created `SETUP_GUIDE.md` with detailed setup instructions
   - Created `assets/README.md` for icon requirements
   - This `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` file

### Updated Files

1. **package.json**
   - Changed from Vite web app to Expo React Native app
   - New dependencies: expo, react-native, expo-clipboard, etc.
   - Updated scripts: `start`, `ios`, `android`, `web`

2. **.gitignore**
   - Added Expo-specific ignores (.expo/, ios/, android/)
   - Added `services/config.js` to protect API keys

3. **All API Services** (in services/ directory)
   - Updated imports: `import { CONFIG } from './config'`
   - Changed `process.env.X` to `CONFIG.X`
   - No other logic changes - API services work as-is

### Files No Longer Used (but still present)

These web app files are no longer needed but weren't deleted:

- `index.html` - Web app HTML
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
- `src/main.js` - Web app JavaScript
- `src/services/*` - Original service files (copied to `services/`)
- `public/*` - Web app assets
- `api/*` - Serverless functions (for Vercel deployment)
- `*.svg` icon files - Replaced with emoji in mobile app

**You can safely delete these if you only want the mobile app.**

## Key Differences: Web vs Mobile

### UI Components

| Web | React Native |
|-----|--------------|
| `<div>` | `<View>` |
| `<button>` | `<TouchableOpacity>` |
| `<input>` | `<TextInput>` |
| `<a>` | `<TouchableOpacity>` + `Linking.openURL()` |
| CSS stylesheets | `StyleSheet.create()` |
| `alert()` | `Alert.alert()` |
| HTML dropdown | `<Modal>` component |

### Features

**Web App:**
- SVG icons for platforms
- CSS animations and transitions
- Copy using `navigator.clipboard`
- Deployed on Vercel

**Mobile App:**
- Emoji icons for platforms (üéµüçé‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
- React Native animations
- Copy using `expo-clipboard`
- Deployed via Expo EAS + App Store

### API Configuration

**Web App:**
- Used `.env.local` file
- Accessed via `process.env.VAR_NAME`
- Deployed with Vercel environment variables

**Mobile App:**
- Uses `services/config.js`
- Accessed via `CONFIG.VAR_NAME`
- Config file is gitignored for security

## Installation & Setup

See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure API keys
cp .env.example services/config.js
# Edit services/config.js with your keys

# Run on iOS
npm start
# Press 'i' for iOS Simulator
```

## Building for Production

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios

# Submit to App Store
eas submit --platform ios
```

## What's Still the Same

‚úÖ All API service logic (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, etc.)
‚úÖ Music conversion algorithms and similarity matching
‚úÖ Support for all 7 music platforms
‚úÖ Bidirectional conversion support
‚úÖ Error handling and validation

## Notes

1. **API Keys Required**: You still need to set up API keys from Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and SoundCloud. See SETUP_GUIDE.md.

2. **Assets Needed**: Before publishing, add app icons to the `assets/` directory. See `assets/README.md`.

3. **Testing**: Test the app in iOS Simulator first. Some features (like opening links in music apps) work better on physical devices.

4. **Android Support**: The code is ready for Android - just run `npm start` and press 'a' for Android emulator.

5. **Web Support**: Expo also supports web! Run `npm start` and press 'w' to open in browser.

## Troubleshooting

**"Module not found" errors:**
- Run `npm install` again
- Clear cache: `expo start -c`

**"Failed to authenticate" errors:**
- Check your API keys in `services/config.js`
- Make sure keys are valid and not expired

**App won't start:**
- Make sure Xcode is installed (for iOS Simulator)
- Update Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Set up API keys in `services/config.js`
2. ‚úÖ Create app icons and add to `assets/`
3. ‚úÖ Test on iOS Simulator
4. ‚úÖ Test on physical device
5. ‚úÖ Set up Expo account and EAS
6. ‚úÖ Build production version
7. ‚úÖ Submit to App Store

**Migration completed successfully!** üéâ

The web app has been fully converted to a native iOS mobile app using React Native and Expo.
