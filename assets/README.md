# Assets Directory

This directory contains app icons and splash screens for the iOS app.

## Required Files

You'll need to add the following files to build the app:

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024px)
   - Main app icon
   - Should be a square PNG with no transparency

2. **splash.png** (1242x2436px or larger)
   - App splash screen
   - Shown while the app is loading

3. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024px, Android only)
   - Android adaptive icon
   - Optional for iOS-only builds

4. **favicon.png** (48x48px, web only)
   - Web favicon
   - Optional for mobile-only apps

## Creating Icons

You can:
1. Design your own icons
2. Use the [Expo Icon Generator](https://buildicon.netlify.app/)
3. Use Figma or other design tools

## Placeholder Files

For development, you can use simple placeholder images. The app will still work without these files during development, but you'll need proper icons before publishing to the App Store.
